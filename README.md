# Chess+ ♟️⚔️

**Chess+** is a Python-based reimagining of traditional chess, built with **Pygame**.  
It blends the strategic foundation of chess with **RPG-inspired mechanics**: health bars, attack stats, and unique special abilities for every piece.  
The result is a fast-paced, tactical experience that challenges players to think beyond standard chess moves.
